Added a confirmation dialog: “Are you sure you want to leave without saving?” when users try to go back from screens like Fill Timesheet and Add Timesheet. This helps prevent accidental data loss.
Added a floating Go Back button at the bottom right for easier access.

Made “Remember Me” on the login screen functional.
When adding a movement register, all fields are reset to default and the date is set to today so the new entry shows immediately.
In the Fill Timesheet flow, the selected task in My Task and Activity is only cleared after the user Save & Close.
Cleared selectedTasks when a filter is applied, when a filter chip is removed, or on refresh — except when using Load More.
Added maximum hours validation to prevent entering unreasonably large hour values.
Users can edit or delete only the timesheets they created.
Added a user name preview on the timesheet card.
Prevented filling a timesheet for the next day.
In filters, the Clear button now only clears filter values and does not close the filter panel.
