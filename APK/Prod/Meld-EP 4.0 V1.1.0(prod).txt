Release note:
Major Highlights
Enabled automatic data refresh whenever a screen gains focus or the user navigates to it.
Added pull-to-refresh message at the top of screens that support pull-to-refresh.
Integrated a rich-text input package, created a reusable rich-text component, and implemented it across the app.
Added rich-text support in My Task & Activity > Card > View > Activity Details.
Added a Meetings/Calendar flow: new Calendar screen (Time Buddy), ICS URL input card, fetch/display ICS data in cards, month/year filters, and ability to create a timesheet from a meeting (preview subject → select Project > Module > Task > Activity → add timesheet line).
Added a status dropdown in My Task & Activity card so users can change activity status; prevented adding timesheet entries for non-Open activities and prevented marking an activity Open until activity details are added.
Replaced Start/End Date with Created/Updated Date in View Task Activity.
UI / UX Improvements
Standardized naming conventions (is/has for booleans, …List for collections, clear handler names, and consistent load/build/update function patterns) — code style only, no behavior changes.
Aligned and grouped imports consistently (Flutter / third-party first, then project imports).
Reorganized file structure with consistent sections: Variable Declarations, Lifecycle, API Calls & Data Ops, Actions & Event Handlers, UI, UI Helpers, Model — for better readability.
Improved Apply Leave bottom card: made Employee Name header visible and prevented Save button from blocking content.
Started work to show only necessary header options in Rich Text Field across screens.
